This is my Stardew Valley Modding Tool-kit.

I made it to help me when modding the Video Game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)
The tool-kit has two functions
  - Dialogue Merging
  - File Count Comparing
  
The Dialogue Merger is designed to work with the game's file structure in mind. It will take two NPC's dialogue (yaml) files, compare them, and create a new file containing the missing dialogue.
This is intended for when two mods have conflicting dialogue files and must be merged.

The File Count Comparison is meant for finding and extracting missing files between two folders. This was also made with the game's file structure in mind, which means it looks for files inside NPC's folders.

The gui's background art and music are taken from the game. I do not own them.

Test files are included.
